## SplitChan
You can embed bigger than 3MB sound files into images, the program will split the files, thus allowing them to be posted.
####Limitations:
* You can only embed one sound
* You have to convert the audio to ogg manually
* For regular embedding use oggchan
* On Linux you have to use mono (it was tested on windows, with mono, it should work without problems)

####Usage:
* The buttons can be used as drag and drop target. Clicking on them will show a file open dialog.
* Saving the file will add the number of the file between the filename and the extension. (e.g.: saving it with `test.png`, the program will generate `test.001.png`, `test.002.png` etc.)
* When posting you have to tag the images with the numbers as you see it on the files (e.g.: `[tag.001]`, `[tag.002]` etc.)
